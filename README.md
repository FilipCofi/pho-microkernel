A simple microkernel implementation with Twitter-like functionality.

## Install

The recommended way to install pho-kernel is through composer.

## Getting Started

Run ```php -a``` on your terminal to switch to PHP shell. Then,

```php
include("play.php"); // this will set it up.

echo $founder; // will dump the founder's ID.
echo $graph; // will dump the graph's ID.

$tweet = $founder->post("My first tweet"); // let's create a tweet.

$new_user = new \PhoNetworksAutogenerated\User($kernel, $graph, "my_password"); // let's create our first user object.
$new_user->like($tweet); // the user likes the one and only tweet in the graph.

// Now examine these:
var_dump($tweet->getLikers());
var_dump($tweet->getAuthors());
var_dump($new_user->getLikes());
var_dump($founder->getPosts());
